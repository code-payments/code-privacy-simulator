# Quick start

You can run these examples by running `npm run examples` from the project root
(one folder up).

Additionally, you can step through the examples in the debugger by running `npm
run examples:debug` from the project root. Then open chrome and go to
`chrome://inspect` and click "Open dedicated DevTools for Node".

## Keypairs

Any keypair generated by the example code will be saved to the `cache/keys`
folder. You can use this folder to recover previously generated keypairs.
